                  <p>Once upon a time a nobleman lived who married after his wife died with a woman who had two daughters and the three of them didn’t have a lot of good virtues. The nobleman had a daughter from the first marriage but she was, unlike her stepsisters, good and beautiful as her mother was.

Right after the marriage the stepmother showed her real face and made her stepdaughter, Cinderella, do all of the house work while sleeping on the attic. She looked after her daughters and dressed them nicely. The girl, despite her misery, got on fine with everything but she couldn’t say anything to her father who was also afraid of the stepmother. Every night after a long day of working she used to sit next to the fire place and that’s way she was called Cinderella.  Even though  she was wearing rags she was still more beautiful than her stepsisters.

One day the king organized a ball for his son and invited all of the nobility. The two stepsisters were looking forward to the dance, made their hair and prepared their dresses. Cinderella selflessly helped them and wanted to go to the dance as every other girl. But dressed badly and filthy because of the ash she couldn’t go anywhere. Her stepsisters agreed with that.

When the big day finally arrived her stepsister went to the ball. Cinderella said goodbye to them in tears and then her godmother who was a good fairy saw her. She felt pity for the poor Cinderella and when she told her she wanted to go to the ball the godmother decided to help her.  First she sent the girl to the garden to get a pumpkin and then she carved it and made a beautiful carriage of it.

After that Cinderella had to bring the mousetrap where 6 mice were caught and as one by one left the mousetrap the fairy godmother turned them into horses and the lizards that Cinderella found were turned into servants.
