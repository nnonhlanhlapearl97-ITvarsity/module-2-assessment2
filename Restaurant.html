               <h3>RESTAURANT</h3>
                  <p>A restaurant, or, more informally, an eatery, is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias, to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments. Our restuarant is the best and we provide healthy food of our people.</p>
